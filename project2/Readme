Completion status:
all requirements are done
1. routing table (distance vector routing)
2. routetrace
3. client (add/delete link, display routing table, create routetrace)
4. two threads in one process


Note:
1. In my design, there are total 5 nodes + 1 client.
   I use the same topology which mentioned in proj2 requirement.
2. To demo my design, 5 remotes should be used:
   node1~2: remote04
   node3:   remote01
   node4:   remote02
   node5:   remote03
   client:  remote07
3. how to run it?
   A: start nodes first
      example in remote04: ./node 1
      example in remote02: ./node 4
   B: then start client (each time input one command)
      example in remote07: ./client commandCode param1 param2
      commandCode:
      10: create route trace
      2:  add link
      3:  remove link
      4:  display routing table
      param1/2: node number, 1~5
4. In order to save remote resource for other students,
   I set the auto-update time slow.(1 second)
5. I don't do too much robust design in this project, especially in client.
